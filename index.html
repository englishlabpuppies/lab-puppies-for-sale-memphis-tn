        <h2>About Fox Red English Labradors</h2>
        <p>Fox Red English Labs are a variation of the yellow Labrador Retriever. Their darker, reddish coat comes from natural genetic modifiers and is completely healthy. These puppies are born lighter and gradually develop their full deep red coat as they grow. Historically, this shade was common in early Labrador bloodlines of the 1800s, and breeders like Sally Kelly helped preserve it for modern families.</p>

        <p>Fox Red Labs are known for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Calm, steady temperament</li>
            <li>High intelligence and easy trainability</li>
            <li>Great with children, seniors, and other pets</li>
            <li>Adaptability for urban or rural environments</li>
        </ul>
